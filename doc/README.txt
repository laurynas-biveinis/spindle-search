 CD / DVD Spindle Search is a plugin to index CDs, DVDs, external hard
 disks and other removable media. It's available free (with source
 code, C# / .Net).

 It is fairly simple to use: select a disk, provide a little
 information about where it is stored, any general comments, and off
 you go. Spindle Search indexes each file on the disk and these show
 up among regular results whenever you do a search.

 When you click on a search result that is stored on removable media,
 Spindle Search brings up a dialog that provides more information
 about the disk on which that file resides, and where the disk itself
 is stored (physically).
